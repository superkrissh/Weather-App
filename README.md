# Weather-App
A weather app is a software application that provides users with information about the weather. Weather apps can be used to track current weather conditions, get forecasts for future weather conditions, and receive alerts about severe weather events.
Weather apps are typically developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to create the structure of the app, CSS is used to style the app, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the app.
To create a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you will need to:
Choose a weather API. A weather API is a service that provides weather data to developers. There are many different weather APIs available, so you will need to choose one that meets your needs.
Create an HTML file. The HTML file will contain the structure of your app.
Add CSS to your HTML file. The CSS will style your app and make it look nice.
Add JavaScript to your HTML file. The JavaScript will add interactivity to your app and allow it to fetch weather data from the weather API.
Test your app. Once you have added all of the necessary code to your app, you will need to test it to make sure that it works properly.
